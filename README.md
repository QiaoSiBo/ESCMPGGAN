# ESCMPGGAN



Pytorch code for the paper 
["ESCMPGGAN: A Progressive Growing GAN Composed of Enhanced Style-Consistent Modulation for Fetal Ultrasound Four-chamber View Editing Synthesis"], which is submitted to the Medical Image Analysis for a Major Revision. We will update this repo when the manuscript is accepted for publication, and then the community can cite and employ our codes and datasets.




### Using the code:

The code is stable using Python 3. 7. 11, Pytorch 1. 7. 1, Torchvision 0. 8. 2, CUDA 11. 0. 221, and CUDNN 8. 0. 5

The ESCMPGGAN is trained with NVIDIA 3090 24G. If you want to know more detailed information about Hardware and Software, please go to our manuscript, thanks!
